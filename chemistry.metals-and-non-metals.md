**Metals:** Physical properties of metals, chemical properties of metals and non-metal oxide.

Metals are the elements that conduct heat and electricity and are malleable and ductile. Examples are Iron (Fe), Aluminium (Al), Silver (Ag), Copper (Cu), Gold (Au), Platinum (Pt), Lead (Pb), Potassium (K), Sodium (Na), Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) etc.

Metals are the elements which form positive ions by losing electrons. Thus, metals are known as Electropositive Elements.

### Physical Properties of Metals

* **Hardness:** Most of the metals are hard, except alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, lithium, etc. are very soft metals. These can be cut by using a knife.
* **Strength:** Most of the metals are strong and have high tensile strength. Because of this, big structures are made using metals, such as copper (Cu) and iron (Fe). (Except Sodium (Na) and potassium (K) which are soft metals).
* **State:** Metals are solid at room temperature except for mercury (Hg).
* **Sound:** Metals produce ringing sound, so, metals are called Sonorous. Sound of metals is also known as Metallic sound. This is the cause that metal wires are used in making musical instruments.
* **Conduction:** Metals are a good conductor of heat and electricity. This is the cause that electric wires are made of metals like copper and aluminium.
* **Malleability:** Metals are malleable. This means metals can be beaten into a thin sheet. Because of this property, iron is used in making big ships.
* **Ductility:** Metals are ductile. This means metals can be drawn into thin wire. Because of this property, a wire is made of metals.
* **Melting and Boiling Point:** Metals have generally high melting and boiling points. (Except sodium and potassium metals which have low melting and boiling point.)
* **Density:** Most of the metals have a high density.
* **Colour:** Most of the metals are grey in colour. But gold and copper are exceptions.

### Chemical Properties of Metals
1. Reaction with oxygen: Most of the metals form respective metal oxides when reacting with oxygen.

Metal + Oxygen â†’ Metal Oxide

Examples:

**Reaction of Potassium with Oxygen:** Potassium metal forms potassium oxide when reacts with oxygen.
