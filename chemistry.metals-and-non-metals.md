**Metals:** Physical properties of metals, chemical properties of metals and non-metal oxide.

Metals are the elements that conduct heat and electricity and are malleable and ductile. Examples are Iron (Fe), Aluminium (Al), Silver (Ag), Copper (Cu), Gold (Au), Platinum (Pt), Lead (Pb), Potassium (K), Sodium (Na), Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) etc.

Metals are the elements which form positive ions by losing electrons. Thus, metals are known as Electropositive Elements.

### Physical Properties of Metals

* **Hardness:** Most of the metals are hard, except alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, lithium, etc. are very soft metals. These can be cut by using a knife.
* **Strength:** Most of the metals are strong and have high tensile strength. Because of this, big structures are made using metals, such as copper (Cu) and iron (Fe). (Except Sodium (Na) and potassium (K) which are soft metals).
* **State:** Metals are solid at room temperature except for mercury (Hg).
* **Sound:** Metals produce ringing sound, so, metals are called Sonorous. Sound of metals is also known as Metallic sound. This is the cause that metal wires are used in making musical instruments.
* **Conduction:** Metals are a good conductor of heat and electricity. This is the cause that electric wires are made of metals like copper and aluminium.
* **Malleability:** Metals are malleable. This means metals can be beaten into a thin sheet. Because of this property, iron is used in making big ships.
* **Ductility:** Metals are ductile. This means metals can be drawn into thin wire. Because of this property, a wire is made of metals.
* **Melting and Boiling Point:** Metals have generally high melting and boiling points. (Except sodium and potassium metals which have low melting and boiling point.)
* **Density:** Most of the metals have a high density.
* **Colour:** Most of the metals are grey in colour. But gold and copper are exceptions.

Silver, gold and platinum do not combine with the oxygen of air even at high temperature. They are the least reactive.

**2. Reaction of metals with water:** Metals form respective hydroxide and hydrogen gas when reacting with water.

Metal + Water → Metal hydroxide + Hydrogen

Most of the metals do not react with water. However, alkali metals react vigorously with water.

**Reaction of Sodium metal with Water:** Sodium metal forms sodium hydroxide and liberates hydrogen gas along with lot of heat when reacting with water.

**Reaction of Aluminium metal with Water:** Reaction of aluminium metal with cold water is too slow to come into notice. But when steam is passed over aluminium metal, aluminium oxide and hydrogen gas are produced.

2Al + 3H2O → Al2O3 + 2H2

**Reaction of Zinc metal with Water:** Zinc metal produces zinc oxide and hydrogen gas when steam is passed over it. Zinc does not react with cold water.

**Reaction of Iron with Water:** Reaction of iron with cold water is very slow and comes into notice after a long time. Iron forms rust (iron oxide) when reacts with moisture present in the atmosphere. Iron oxide and hydrogen gas are formed by passing of steam over iron metal.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983135248_6a491d8fae_o.png)

**Both calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are heavier than water but still float over it:** Both calcium and magnesium float over water surface because hydrogen gas is evolved when these metals react with water. It is in the form of bubbles which stick on the metal surface. Therefore, they float over it.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46944197175_0258c88982_o.png)

Other metals usually do not react with water or react very slowly. Lead, copper, silver and gold do not react with steam. Thus, the order of reactivity of different metals towards water may be written as :

K > Na > Ca > Mg > Ae > Zn > Fe > Pb > Cu > Ag > Au

**3. Reaction of metals with dilute acid:** Metals form respective salts when reacting with dilute acid.

Metal + dil. acid → Metal salt + Hydrogen

**Hydrogen (H2) gas is not evolved when metal is treated with nitric acid (HNO3):**

Nitric acid is strong oxidising agent and it oxidises the hydrogen gas (H2) liberated into water (H2O) and itself get reduced to some oxide of nitrogen like nitrous oxide (N2O)3 nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).

Copper, gold, silver are known as noble metals. These do not react with water or dilute acids.

The order of reactivity of metal towards dilute hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid is in the order;

K > Na > Ca > Mg > Al > Zn > Fe > Cu > Hg > Ag

**Reaction of Zinc oxide and Aluminium oxide:** Aluminium oxide and zinc oxide are insoluble in water. Aluminium oxide and zinc oxide are amphoteric in nature. An amphoteric substance shows both acidic and basic characters. It reacts with base like acid and reacts with an acid like a base.

When zinc oxide reacts with sodium hydroxide, it behaves like an acid. In this reaction, sodium zincate and water are formed.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136568_85c8f4122d_o.png)

Zinc oxide behaves like a base when reacts with acid. Zinc oxide gives zinc chloride and water on reaction with hydrochloric acid.

**Reactivity Series of Metals:** The order of intensity or reactivity of metal is known as Reactivity Series. Reactivity of elements decreases on moving from top to bottom in the given reactivity series.

In the reactivity series, copper, gold, and silver are at the bottom and hence, least reactive. These metals are known as Noble metals. Potassium is at the top of the series and hence, most reactive.

Reactivity of some metals are given in descending order :

K > Na > Ca > Mg > Al > Zn > Fe > Pb > Cu

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136738_bb24403554_o.png)

**4. Reaction of metals with solution of other metal salts:** Reaction of metals with the solution of other metal salt is displacement reaction. In this reaction, more reactive metal displaces the less reactive metal from its salt.

Metal A + Salt of metal B → Salt of metal A + Metal B

Examples :

Iron displaces copper from copper sulphate solution.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40893896693_06439b210e_o.png)

Similarly, aluminium and zinc displace copper from the solution of copper sulphate.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136778_1ea0bdee55_o.png)

In all the above examples, iron, aluminium and zinc are more reactive than copper. This is why they displace copper from its salt solution.
When copper is dipped in the solution of silver nitrate, it displaces silver and forms copper nitrate.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136818_d3b402223a_o.png)

In the reaction, copper is more reactive than silver and hence, displaces silver from silver nitrate solution.
Silver metal does not react with copper sulphate solution because silver is less reactive than copper and not able to displace copper from its salt solution.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40893896713_d49177ffcb_o.png)

Similarly, when gold is dipped in the solution of copper nitrate, no reaction takes place because copper is more reactive than gold.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136898_36b3c66d68_o.png)

In similar way, no reaction takes place when copper is dipped in the solution of aluminium nitrate because copper is less reactive than aluminium.

**Non-Metals:** Physical Properties of non-metals, chemical properties of non-metals, non¬metal oxides, Reaction of metal and Non-metal, Ionic bonds and formation of an ionic bond. Non-metals are the elements that do not conduct electricity and are neither malleable nor ductile.

Examples: Carbon (C), Sulphur (S), Phosphorous (P), Silicon (Si), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br), Neon (Ne) and Argon (Ar) etc.
Non-metals are the elements which form negative ions by gaining an electron. Thus, non¬metals are also known as Electronegative Elements.

### Physical properties of non-metals

* **Hardness:** Non-metals are not hard rather they are generally soft. But the diamond is an exception; it is the hardest naturally occurring substance.
* **State:** Non-metals may be solid, liquid or gas.
* **Lustre:** Non-metals have a dull appearance. Diamond and iodine are exceptions.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47070969604_15b08de494_o.png)

**3. Reaction of Non-metals with Hydrogen:** Non-metals reactive with hydrogen to form covalent hydrides.

Non-metal + Hydrogen → Covalent Hydride

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47070969634_c3165105be_o.png)

Non-metals do not react with water (or steam) to evolve Hydrogen gas.

Non-metals do not react with dilute acids.

**4. Reaction of Metal and Non-metal:** Many metals form ionic bonds when they react with non-metals. Compounds so formed are known as Ionic Compounds.

**Ions:** Positive or negative charged atoms are known as ions. Ions are formed because of loss or gain of electrons. Atoms form ions obtain by the electronic configuration of the nearest noble gas.

**Positive ion:** A positive ion is formed because of the loss of electrons by an atom.

Following are some examples of positive ions:

Sodium forms sodium ion because of the loss of one electron. Because of the loss of one electron, one positive charge comes over sodium.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136268_2f884a5d43_o.png)

Magnesium forms positive ion because of the loss of two electrons. Two positive charges come over magnesium because of loss of two electrons.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46944197975_46dc21cedd_o.png)

**Negative ion:** A negative ion is formed because of the gain of an electron.

Some examples are given below :
Chlorine gains one electron in order to achieve a stable configuration. After the loss of one electron, chlorine gets one negative charge over it forming chlorine ion.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136208_ca9d43afb5_o.png)

**Ionic Bonds:** Ionic bonds are formed because of transfer of electrons from metal to non¬metal. In this course, metals get positive charge because of transfer of electrons and non-metal gets negative charge because of acceptance of electrons. In other words, bond formed between positive and negative ion is called Ionic Bond.

Since, a compound is electrically neutral, so to form an ionic compound, negative and positive both ions must be combined.

Some examples are given below:

**Formation of Sodium Chloride (NaCl):** In sodium chloride, sodium is a metal (alkali metal) and chlorine is a non-metal.

Atomic number of sodium = 11

Electronic configuration of sodium : 2, 8, 1

Number of electrons in outermost orbit = 1

Valence electrons = Electrons in outermost orbit = 1

Atomic number of chlorine = 17

Electronic configuration of chlorine : 2, 8, 7

Electrons in outermost orbit = 7

Therefore, valence electrons = ?

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136178_caeb8ccb61_o.png)

Sodium has one valence electron and chlorine has seven valence electrons. Sodium requires losing one electron to obtain stable configuration and chlorine requires gaining one electron in order to obtain stable electronic configuration. Thus, in order to obtain stable configuration, sodium transfers one electron to chlorine. After loss of one electron, sodium gets one positive charge (+) and chlorine gets one negative charge after gain of one electron. Sodium chloride is formed because of transfer of electrons. Thus, ionic bond is formed between sodium and chlorine. Since, sodium chloride is formed because of ionic bond, thus, it is called Ionic compound. In similar way, potassium chloride (KCl) is formed.


### Properties of Ionic compound

* Ionic compounds are solid. Ionic bond has a greater force of attraction because of which ions attract each other strongly. This makes ionic compounds solid.
* Ionic compounds are brittle.
* Ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points because force of attraction between ions of ionic compounds is very strong.
* Ionic compounds generally dissolve in water.
* Ionic compounds are generally insoluble in organic solvents; like kerosene, petrol, etc.
* Ionic compounds do not conduct electricity in the solid state.
* The solution of ionic compounds in water conduct electricity. This happens because ions present in the solution of ionic compound facilitate the passage of electricity by moving towards opposite electrodes.
* Ionic compounds conduct electricity in the molten state.

**Occurrence and Extraction of Metals:** Minerals, ores, extraction of metals of least reactivity, extraction of metals of middle reactivity, extraction of metals of high reactivity, refining or purification of metals and corrosion.

### Occurrence and Extraction of Metals:

**Source of metal:** Metals occur in Earth’s crust and in seawater; in the form of ores. Earth’s crust is the major source of metal. Seawater contains many salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc.

**Mineral:** Minerals are naturally occurring substances which have a uniform composition.

**Ores:** The minerals from which a metal can be profitably extracted are called Ores.

Metals found at the bottom of reactivity series are least reactive and they are often found in nature in free-state; such as gold, silver, copper, etc. Copper and silver are also found in the form of sulphide and oxide ores.

Metals found in the middle of reactivity series, such as Zn, Fe, Pb, etc. are usually found in the form of oxides, sulphides or carbonates.

Metals found at the top of the reactivity series are never found in free-state as they are very reactive, example; K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al, etc.

Many metals are found in the form of oxides because oxygen is abundant in nature and is very reactive.

**Extraction of Metals:** Metals can be categorised into three parts on the basis of their reactivity: Most reactive, medium reactive and least reactive.

The three major steps involved in the extraction of a metal from its ore are

1. Concentration or enrichment of ores.
2. Conversion of concentrated ore into crude metal and,
3. Refining of impure or crude metal.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46944197875_5c77053a3d_o.png)

**1. Concentration of Ores:** Removal of impurities, such as soil, sand, stone, silicates, etc. from mines ore is known as Concentration of Ores.

Ores which are mined often contain many impurities. These impurities are called gangue. First of all, concentration is done to remove impurities from ores. The concentration of ores is also known as enrichment of ores. Process of concentration depends upon physical and chemical properties of ores. Gravity separation, electromagnetic separation, froth flotation process, etc. are some examples of the processes which are applied for concentration of ores.

**2. Conversion of Concentrated Ore into Crude Metal:**

Conversion of metals ores into oxides: It is easy to obtain metals from their oxides. So, ores found in the form of sulphide and carbonates are first converted to their oxides by the process of roasting and calcination. Oxides of metals so obtained are converted into metals by the process of reduction.

**Roasting:** Heating of sulphide ores in the presence of excess air to convert them into oxides is known as Roasting.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136078_1f6c606c2e_o.png)

**Calcination:** Heating of carbonate ores in the limited supply of air to convert them into oxides is known as Calcination.
