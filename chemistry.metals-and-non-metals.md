**Metals:** Physical properties of metals, chemical properties of metals and non-metal oxide.

Metals are the elements that conduct heat and electricity and are malleable and ductile. Examples are Iron (Fe), Aluminium (Al), Silver (Ag), Copper (Cu), Gold (Au), Platinum (Pt), Lead (Pb), Potassium (K), Sodium (Na), Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) etc.

Metals are the elements which form positive ions by losing electrons. Thus, metals are known as Electropositive Elements.

### Physical Properties of Metals

* **Hardness:** Most of the metals are hard, except alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, lithium, etc. are very soft metals. These can be cut by using a knife.
* **Strength:** Most of the metals are strong and have high tensile strength. Because of this, big structures are made using metals, such as copper (Cu) and iron (Fe). (Except Sodium (Na) and potassium (K) which are soft metals).
* **State:** Metals are solid at room temperature except for mercury (Hg).
* **Sound:** Metals produce ringing sound, so, metals are called Sonorous. Sound of metals is also known as Metallic sound. This is the cause that metal wires are used in making musical instruments.
* **Conduction:** Metals are a good conductor of heat and electricity. This is the cause that electric wires are made of metals like copper and aluminium.
* **Malleability:** Metals are malleable. This means metals can be beaten into a thin sheet. Because of this property, iron is used in making big ships.
* **Ductility:** Metals are ductile. This means metals can be drawn into thin wire. Because of this property, a wire is made of metals.
* **Melting and Boiling Point:** Metals have generally high melting and boiling points. (Except sodium and potassium metals which have low melting and boiling point.)
* **Density:** Most of the metals have a high density.
* **Colour:** Most of the metals are grey in colour. But gold and copper are exceptions.

Lithium, potassium, sodium, etc. are known as Alkali-metals. Alkali metals react vigorously with oxygen.

**Reaction of Copper metal with Oxygen:** Copper does not react with oxygen at room temperature but when burnt in air, it gives oxide.

Silver, gold and platinum do not combine with the oxygen of air even at high temperature. They are the least reactive.

**2. Reaction of metals with water:** Metals form respective hydroxide and hydrogen gas when reacting with water.

Metal + Water → Metal hydroxide + Hydrogen

Most of the metals do not react with water. However, alkali metals react vigorously with water.

**Reaction of Sodium metal with Water:** Sodium metal forms sodium hydroxide and liberates hydrogen gas along with lot of heat when reacting with water.

**Reaction of Aluminium metal with Water:** Reaction of aluminium metal with cold water is too slow to come into notice. But when steam is passed over aluminium metal, aluminium oxide and hydrogen gas are produced.

2Al + 3H2O → Al2O3 + 2H2

**Reaction of Zinc metal with Water:** Zinc metal produces zinc oxide and hydrogen gas when steam is passed over it. Zinc does not react with cold water.

**Both calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) are heavier than water but still float over it:** Both calcium and magnesium float over water surface because hydrogen gas is evolved when these metals react with water. It is in the form of bubbles which stick on the metal surface. Therefore, they float over it.

Other metals usually do not react with water or react very slowly. Lead, copper, silver and gold do not react with steam. Thus, the order of reactivity of different metals towards water may be written as :

K > Na > Ca > Mg > Ae > Zn > Fe > Pb > Cu > Ag > Au

**3. Reaction of metals with dilute acid:** Metals form respective salts when reacting with dilute acid.

Metal + dil. acid → Metal salt + Hydrogen

Reaction of Sodium metal with dilute hydrochloric acid: Sodium metal gives sodium chloride and hydrogen gas when react with dilute hydrochloric acid.

**Hydrogen (H2) gas is not evolved when metal is treated with nitric acid (HNO3):**

Nitric acid is strong oxidising agent and it oxidises the hydrogen gas (H2) liberated into water (H2O) and itself get reduced to some oxide of nitrogen like nitrous oxide (N2O)3 nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).

Copper, gold, silver are known as noble metals. These do not react with water or dilute acids.

The order of reactivity of metal towards dilute hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid is in the order;

K > Na > Ca > Mg > Al > Zn > Fe > Cu > Hg > Ag

**Metal Oxides:**

Chemical Properties: Metal oxides are basic in nature. The aqueous solution of metal oxides turns red litmus blue.

Reaction of Metal oxides with Water: Most of the metal oxides are insoluble in water. Alkali metal oxides are soluble in water. Alkali metal oxides give strong base when dissolved in water.

**Reaction of Sodium oxide with Water:** Sodium oxide gives sodium hydroxide when reacts with water.

**Reaction of Potassium oxide with Water:** Potassium oxide gives potassium hydroxide when reacts with water.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136518_97373f91cb_o.png)

**Reaction of Zinc oxide and Aluminium oxide:** Aluminium oxide and zinc oxide are insoluble in water. Aluminium oxide and zinc oxide are amphoteric in nature. An amphoteric substance shows both acidic and basic characters. It reacts with base like acid and reacts with an acid like a base.

When zinc oxide reacts with sodium hydroxide, it behaves like an acid. In this reaction, sodium zincate and water are formed.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136568_85c8f4122d_o.png)

Zinc oxide behaves like a base when reacts with acid. Zinc oxide gives zinc chloride and water on reaction with hydrochloric acid.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136618_63d659d130_o.png)

In a similar way, aluminium oxide behaves like a base when reacts with acid and behaves like acid when reacts with a base.

Aluminium oxide gives sodium aluminate along with water when reacts with sodium hydroxide.

**Reactivity Series of Metals:** The order of intensity or reactivity of metal is known as Reactivity Series. Reactivity of elements decreases on moving from top to bottom in the given reactivity series.

In the reactivity series, copper, gold, and silver are at the bottom and hence, least reactive. These metals are known as Noble metals. Potassium is at the top of the series and hence, most reactive.

Reactivity of some metals are given in descending order :

K > Na > Ca > Mg > Al > Zn > Fe > Pb > Cu

**4. Reaction of metals with solution of other metal salts:** Reaction of metals with the solution of other metal salt is displacement reaction. In this reaction, more reactive metal displaces the less reactive metal from its salt.

Metal A + Salt of metal B → Salt of metal A + Metal B

Examples :

Iron displaces copper from copper sulphate solution.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40893896693_06439b210e_o.png)

Similarly, aluminium and zinc displace copper from the solution of copper sulphate.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136778_1ea0bdee55_o.png)

In all the above examples, iron, aluminium and zinc are more reactive than copper. This is why they displace copper from its salt solution.
When copper is dipped in the solution of silver nitrate, it displaces silver and forms copper nitrate.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136818_d3b402223a_o.png)

In the reaction, copper is more reactive than silver and hence, displaces silver from silver nitrate solution.
Silver metal does not react with copper sulphate solution because silver is less reactive than copper and not able to displace copper from its salt solution.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40893896713_d49177ffcb_o.png)

Similarly, when gold is dipped in the solution of copper nitrate, no reaction takes place because copper is more reactive than gold.

![alt image](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33983136898_36b3c66d68_o.png)

In similar way, no reaction takes place when copper is dipped in the solution of aluminium nitrate because copper is less reactive than aluminium.

**Non-Metals:** Physical Properties of non-metals, chemical properties of non-metals, non¬metal oxides, Reaction of metal and Non-metal, Ionic bonds and formation of an ionic bond. Non-metals are the elements that do not conduct electricity and are neither malleable nor ductile.

Examples: Carbon (C), Sulphur (S), Phosphorous (P), Silicon (Si), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), Chlorine (Cl), Bromine (Br), Neon (Ne) and Argon (Ar) etc.
Non-metals are the elements which form negative ions by gaining an electron. Thus, non¬metals are also known as Electronegative Elements.

### Physical properties of non-metals

* **Hardness:** Non-metals are not hard rather they are generally soft. But the diamond is an exception; it is the hardest naturally occurring substance.
* **State:** Non-metals may be solid, liquid or gas.
* **Lustre:** Non-metals have a dull appearance. Diamond and iodine are exceptions.
* **Sonority:** Non-metals are not sonorous, i.e., they do not produce a typical sound on being hit.
* **Conduction:** Non-metals are a bad conductor of heat and electricity. Graphite which is allotrope of carbon is a good conductor of electricity and is an exception.
* **Malleability and ductility:** Non-metals are brittle.
* **Melting and boiling point:** Non-metals have generally low melting and boiling points.
* **Density:** Most of the non-metals have low density.
* **Colour:** Non-metals are in many colours.

Carbon in the form of graphite is non-metal which conduct electricity.

Iodine is non-metal which is lustrous having a shining surface.

Carbon in the form of diamond is a non-metal which is extremely hard.

Diamond is a non-metal which has a very high melting point and boiling point.

### Chemical properties of Non-metals
**1. Reaction of Non-metals with Oxygen:** Non-metals form respective oxide when reacting with oxygen.

Non-metal + Oxygen → Non-metallic oxide

When carbon reacts with oxygen, carbon dioxide is formed along with the production of heat.
