* Electric current is the flow of charge.

* If positive charge flows, direction of the current is taken in the direction of the flow. If negative charge flows, direction of the current is taken opposite to the direction of flow of charge.

* Current can flow in conductors but no flow of current is possible in insulators as the electrons in conductors can move but the ones in insulators can't move.
