* The **earth's crust** has only 0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, bicarbonates, coal and petroleum).

* The **atmosphere** has 0.03% of carbon dioxide.

* Inspite of its small amount available in the nature carbon is a **versatile element** as it forms the basis of all living organisims and many things which we use.

* ##  **Bonding in Carbon:**
1. Atomic number of carbon = 6.

2. Electronic configuration has 2 electrons in its K shell and 4 electrons in L shell.

3. In order to attain the noble gas configuration, carbon should either gain or loose 4 electrons or it can share it's  4 electrons with some other element.

4. **Gain of 4 electrons** (to form octet, *i.e.*, 8 electrons in C4- anion) is difficult because then a nucleus with 6 protons will have to hold extra 4 electrons.

5. **Loss of 4 electrons** (to attain duplet, *i.e*, 2 electrons like He in atom C4+ cation) is difficult as it requires large amount of energy to remove 4 electrons.

6. Carbon hence, overcomes this difficulty by **sharing** it's **four** valance electrons with other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements.
**These electrons contributed by the atoms for mutual sharing in order to acquire the stable noble gas configuration called covalency of that atom.** Hence carbon shows **TETRACOVALENCY.**

7. The simplest molecule formed by sharing electrons (*i.e.*, covalent bonds), can be represented by electron dot structure.

* **Allotropes of carbon:** The phenomenon by means of which an element can exist an element can exist in two or more forms, with similar chemical properties but different physical properties is called allotropy and the different forms are called allotropes.
Carbon shows three allotropic forms :
1. Diamond

2. Graphite 

3. Fullerenes

* **Fullerenes:** A new category of carbon allotrope, fullerenes are spherical in shape or a soccer ball like.
**The first fullerene identified** was **C-60** with 60 carbon atoms arranged like the godesic dome designed by the US architect, **Buckminster Fuller**, hence these are also known as **Buckminster Fullerenes** or **Bucky Ball structures**.

* **Causes of versatile nature of carbon are:** Four main reasons for versatile nature of carbon are:
1. **Catenation:** It is the unique property of self linkage of carbon atoms by means of covalent bonds to form straight chains, or branched chains, or the rings of different sizes .

2. **Tetracovalency:** Due to small size, and presence of four valence electrons, carbon can form strong bonds with other atoms, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, or sulphur, etc. For example, compounds of carbon with hydrogen are called hydrocarbons.

3. **Multiple Bond Formation:** Small size of carbon also enables it to form multiple bonds, (*i.e*, double bonds or triple bonds) with other elements as well as with its own atoms. This increases the number of carbon compounds.

4. **Isomerism:** The phenomenon by means of which the carbon compunds with same molecular
