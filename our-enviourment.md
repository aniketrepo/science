## Enviourment
Our surroundings are called the **Enviourment**.

Note-
1. Living and Non-living beings are present in the enviourment.
2. They are dependent on each other.

## Living beings are of three types-
1. **Producers (Autotrophs):** Organisms which produce their own food are called **Producers (or Autotrophs)**. For e.g., Plants.

2. **Consumers (Heterotrophs):** Organisms which are dependant on other organisms for food are called **Consumers (or Heterotrophs)**. For e.g, Animals, Humans, etc. Consumers are of three types, they are-
* **Herbivores:** These organisms feed mostly on plants. For e.g., Deer, Cow, Elephant, etc.

* **Carnivores:** These organisms feed mostly on meat or the flesh of other animals. For e.g., Lion, Wolf, Tiger, etc.

* **Omnivores:** These organisms feed on both, plants, and flesh of other animals. For e.g., Humans, Crow, etc.

3. **Decomposers:** Organisms which feed on dead and decaying matter of plants and animals are called **Decomposers**. For e.g., Bacteria, Mushrooms, Worms, etc. Note-
* Decomposers clean up the enviourment by decomposing dead organisms.
* They break the complex compounds in the body of an organism into simpler compounds i.e. nutrients. These nutrients mix with soil, making soil more fertile.

## Food Chain
A food chain is a series of organisms, in which every next organism is dependent on the one before it.
For e.g.,
* Plants - Grasshopper - Frog - Snake - Hawk
* Plants - Deer - Lion
* Algae - Inscet - Fish - Bird

## Food Web
Different Food Chains interlinked form a Food Web.

## Trophic Levels
The trophic level of an organism is the position it occupies in a food web.

## Flow of energy
* Sun is ultimate source of energy.
* Only 1% of solar energy coming to earth is absorbed by plants.
* Plants convert this energy to chemical energy by the process of photosynthesis.
* Some of this energy is lost by plants to surrounding, rest is stored in body of plants.
* Almost 90% of this energy is utilized for the plant's own needs and rest 10% is left for the organism at the next trophic level. So, very little energy is left for the organism which is at the tertiary level. Flow of energy is unidirectional.

## Biological Magnification
It is the increasing buildup of toxic substances within organisms that happens at each stage of the food chain.

## Ecosystem
Ecosystem refers to a system that includes all living organisms. There are two types of components found in an ecosystem-
1. **Biotic Component:** Biotic components are all the living things in an ecosystem. They are the animals, the plants and the microorganisms. Biotic components also include the waste from living things and dead organisms. Even the harshest corners of our planet have biotic components.

2. **Abiotic Component:** Abiotic components or abiotic factors are the non living component of the ecosystem. They are also known as environmental factors. In other words, it is a sum covering of all the ecosystem. Abiotic factors are atmosphere, chemical, sunlight/temperature, wind, and water. Note-
* Air provides oxygen (for respiration), and carbon dioxide (for photosynthesis), and other gases for various needs of the living beings.
* Water is essential for all living beings because all the metabolic activities happen in the presence of water.
* Soil is the reservoir of various nutrients which are utilized by plants

## Our Effect on the Enviourment
* **Waste:** Due to our waste environment get polluted.For e.g., kitchen waste, paper, polythene, wood, glass, metal cans, and detergents.
* **Sewage:** Waste products generated by humans. For e.g., Commercial waste: from shops, hospitals waste Industrial waste: chemical which are used in industry.
* **E-Waste/Electronic Waste:** Useless mobile phones, computer systems and old electronic instruments.

## Types of Wastes
Wastes are of two types:
