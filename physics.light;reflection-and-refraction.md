* Light travels in a straight line

* Light gets reflected when it falls on polished surfaces; like mirrors.

* Light suffers refraction when it travels from one medium to another.

* There is a change in the wavelength of light when it moves from one medium into another.

* The bouncing back of light when it strikes a smooth surface is called reflection of light. Reflection is of two types; Specular or Regular and Diffuse or irregular reflection.

* The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Mathematically, we have ∠i = ∠r.

* The image is far behind the mirror as the object is in the front.

* The image is unmagnified, virtual and erect.

* The image has right-left reversal.

* Focal length of a plane mirror is infinity.

* Power of a plane mirror is zero.

* If a plane mirror is turned by an angle, the reflected ray turns by 20.

* The least size of a plane mirror to view an object is equal to half the size of the object.

* ### Pole (Vertex)
The central point of a mirror is called its pole.

* ### Centre of Curvature
The centre of the sphere which the mirror is the part is called the centre of curvature. It is denoted by C.

* ### Radius of Curvature
The radius of the sphere of which the mirror is a part is called the centre of curvature. It is denoted by R.

* ### Principal Axis
The straight line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature is called the principal axis.

* ### Principal Focus
It is a point on the principal axis at which the rays parallel to the principal axis meet after reflection or seem to come from.
