* Light is necessary for seeing objects.

* We see an object when a light ray from it reaches our eyes. That light ray may be the light of the object itself or it may be a reflected light ray from some another source.

* Sources of light which emit their own light are called Luminous Sources. For example; Sun, Light bulb etc.

* Sources of light which do not emit their own light but reflect the light from another source of light are known as Non- Luminous Sources. For example; Moon, Table etc.

* Light is a form of energy.

* Light travels in a straight line.

* Light can form shadows.

* **Shiny/Smooth Surfaces**- These surfaces reflect more and absorb less light. For example; Aluminum foil, Floor tiles etc.

* **Dull/Rough Surfaces**- These surfaces reflect less and absorb more light. For example; Sand paper, Cement road etc.

## Terms related to reflection of light

* **Incident ray**- The ray of light falling on the mirror surface. It is denoted by *'i'*.

* **Reflected ray**- The ray of light sent back by the mirror. It is denoted by *'r'*.

* **Point of incidence**- The point on the mirror where the incident ray falls.

* **Normal**- It is a line perpendicular to the mirror drawn at the point of incidence.

* **Angle of incidence**- The angle between the incident ray and the normal.

* **Angle of reflection**- The angle between the reflected ray and the normal.

## Laws of reflection of light

* **First law of reflection**- The incident ray, the normal and the reflected ray all lie on the same plane.

* **Second law of reflection**- The angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are always equal.
