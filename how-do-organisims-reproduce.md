# Reproduction
The process by which living organisms produce its own kind of indivudials to mantain the continuity of speicies is called **Reproduction**.

Reproduction is mainly of two types:-
1. Asexual Reproduction
2. Sexual Reproduction
  
## Asexual Reproduction
* It involves only one parent.
* There is no formation and fusion of gametes.
* The young ones formed are almost identical to each other as well as to the parent cell.
* Asexual reproduction generally occurs during favourable environmental conditions and when there is an abundance of food.
* It is a faster method of reproduction.
  
### Modes Of Asexual Reproduction
  Asexual Reproduction occours in unicellular organisims by fission, budding, spore formation, fragmentaiton, regeneration (in animals), and vegetative propogation (in plants). It occurs in multicellular organisims by budding and regeneration.
