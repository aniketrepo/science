# Reproduction
The process by which living organisms produce its own kind of indivudials to mantain the continuity of speicies is called **Reproduction**.

Reproduction is mainly of two types:-
1. Asexual Reproduction
2. Sexual Reproduction
  
## Asexual Reproduction
* It involves only one parent.
* There is no formation and fusion of gametes.
* The young ones formed are almost identical to each other as well as to the parent cell.
* Asexual reproduction generally occurs during favourable environmental conditions and when there is an abundance of food.
* It is a faster method of reproduction.

### Modes Of Asexual Reproduction
  Asexual Reproduction occours in unicellular organisims by fission, budding, spore formation, fragmentaiton, regeneration (in animals), and vegetative propogation (in plants). It occurs in multicellular organisims by budding and regeneration.
  
  These are as follows:-
  
**1. Fission:** The process where unicellular organism splits itself into two or more daughter cells. It is of two types i.e.
  
  **(a) Binary Fission:** In this process, parent cell divides into two identical daughter cells, e.g. *Amoeba, Leishmania*.
  In this process, nuclear division is followed by cytoplasmic division.

  **(b) Multiple Fission:** In this process the parent cell divides into many identical daughter organisms simultaneously, e.g. *Plasmodium*.

**2. Fragmentation:** The parent body on maturation breaks-up in two or more small fragments, which later grow into complete new organism, e.g. *Spirogyra*.

**3. Regeneration:** In this process, all fragments or parts that are seperated from the body develop in new animals, e.g. *sponge, Planaria, Hydra*.

**4. Budding:** A daughter organism is formed from a small projection known as **bud**. It develops as an outgrowth due to repeated cell divisions of the parent body. When fully grown, it deataches to grow into a new independent indivudial, e.g. *Hydra*.

**5. Vegetative Propogation:** The process of obtaining complete plant from any vegetative part of plant is called vegetative propogation. This is mainly of two 
types i.e.

  **(a) Natural Vegetative Propogation:** The vegetative propogation that occurs automatically in plants is called natural vegetative propogation. It can be achieved by root, stem, leaf, etc, e.g. *Bryophyllum*.

  **(b) Artificial Vegetative Propogation:** The artifically made vegetative propagules in plants by humans, is called artificial vegetative propogation, e.g. cutting, layering, grafting, etc.
  
  * **Grafting:** A small part of stem from one plant without roots (scion) is attached to the part with root (stock) of another plant.
  * **Layering:** The development of roots on a stem, while the stem is still attached to the parent plant is called layering.
  * **Tissue Culture:** It is a technique used for growing new plants using living tissues (like flower buds, stems, growing tips, leaves, etc.) *invitro* in an artificial culture medium.

**6. Spore Formation:** It is a type of asexual reproduction where blob-like structures called **Sporangia** are involved. These cells or spores have the ability to germinate under favourable conditions forming new plants, e.g. *Rhizopus*.

## Sexual Reproduction
The mode of reproduction that takes place with the involvement of two individuals of two different sexes i.e. male and female.

In this type of reproduction, both sexes, i.e. male and female are involved. Sex cell or gamete of one parent (male) fuses with the sex cell or gamete of another parent (female). This results in the reproduction of a new cell called **Zygote**.

Thus, the sexual mode of reproduction involves two major processes
* Formation of gametes by meisosis
* Fusion of gametes

Significance of Sexual Reproduction :
* Sexual reproduction involves DNA as well as cellular apparatus of two different organisms which promotes diversity of characters in the offspring.
* Since gametes are derived from two different organisms, it results in a new combination of genes which increases the chances of genetic variations.
* Sexual reproduction results in the origin of. new species.
* Sexual reproduction involves division in the sex organs that reduces the DNA matter to half so that the zygote formed after fusion has the same amount of DNA as the parents it maintains DNA in a species.
