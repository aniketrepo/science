# Reproduction
The process by which living organisms produce its own kind of indivudials to mantain the continuity of speicies is called **Reproduction**.

Reproduction is mainly of two types:-
1. Asexual Reproduction
2. Sexual Reproduction
  
## Asexual Reproduction
* It involves only one parent.
* There is no formation and fusion of gametes.
* The young ones formed are almost identical to each other as well as to the parent cell.
* Asexual reproduction generally occurs during favourable environmental conditions and when there is an abundance of food.
* It is a faster method of reproduction.

### Modes of Asexual Reproduction
  Asexual Reproduction occours in unicellular organisims by fission, budding, spore formation, fragmentaiton, regeneration (in animals), and vegetative propogation (in plants). It occurs in multicellular organisims by budding and regeneration.
  
  These are as follows:-
  
**1. Fission:** The process where unicellular organism splits itself into two or more daughter cells. It is of two types i.e.
  
  **(a) Binary Fission:** In this process, parent cell divides into two identical daughter cells, e.g. *Amoeba, Leishmania*.
  In this process, nuclear division is followed by cytoplasmic division.

  **(b) Multiple Fission:** In this process the parent cell divides into many identical daughter organisms simultaneously, e.g. *Plasmodium*.

**2. Fragmentation:** The parent body on maturation breaks-up in two or more small fragments, which later grow into complete new organism, e.g. *Spirogyra*.

**3. Regeneration:** In this process, all fragments or parts that are seperated from the body develop in new animals, e.g. *sponge, Planaria, Hydra*.

**4. Budding:** A daughter organism is formed from a small projection known as **bud**. It develops as an outgrowth due to repeated cell divisions of the parent body. When fully grown, it deataches to grow into a new independent indivudial, e.g. *Hydra*.

**5. Vegetative Propogation:** The process of obtaining complete plant from any vegetative part of plant is called vegetative propogation. This is mainly of two 
types i.e.

  **(a) Natural Vegetative Propogation:** The vegetative propogation that occurs automatically in plants is called natural vegetative propogation. It can be achieved by root, stem, leaf, etc, e.g. *Bryophyllum*.

  **(b) Artificial Vegetative Propogation:** The artifically made vegetative propagules in plants by humans, is called artificial vegetative propogation, e.g. cutting, layering, grafting, etc.
  
  * **Grafting:** A small part of stem from one plant without roots (scion) is attached to the part with root (stock) of another plant.
  * **Layering:** The development of roots on a stem, while the stem is still attached to the parent plant is called layering.
  * **Tissue Culture:** It is a technique used for growing new plants using living tissues (like flower buds, stems, growing tips, leaves, etc.) *invitro* in an artificial culture medium.

**6. Spore Formation:** It is a type of asexual reproduction where blob-like structures called **Sporangia** are involved. These cells or spores have the ability to germinate under favourable conditions forming new plants, e.g. *Rhizopus*.

## Sexual Reproduction
The mode of reproduction that takes place with the involvement of two individuals of two different sexes i.e. male and female.

In this type of reproduction, both sexes, i.e. male and female are involved. Sex cell or gamete of one parent (male) fuses with the sex cell or gamete of another parent (female). This results in the reproduction of a new cell called **Zygote**.

Thus, the sexual mode of reproduction involves two major processes
* Formation of gametes by meisosis
* Fusion of gametes

## Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants
**Angiosperms** bear the reproductive parts within the flower and their seeds are enclosed in a fruit. Most plants have both male and female reproductive organs in the same flower and are known as **Bisexual Flowers**. While, others which have either male and female reproductive parts in a flower are known as **Unisexual Flowers**.

A flower comprises of four main parts, i.e. sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. Stamens and carpels are the reproductive parts of a flower.

**1. Stamen:** It is the male reproductive part of the flower.

**2. Anther:** It is a bilobed structure containing two pollen sacks present at the tip of the stamen. These produce pollen grains that are yellowish in colour.

**3. Carpel (Pistil):** It is the female reproductive part which is present at the centre of the flower. It comprises of three parts
  * **Stigma:** It is the terminal part of carpel which may be sticky. It helps in receiving the pollen grains during pollintaion.
  * **Style:** It is the middle elongnated part of carpel. It helps in the attachment of stigma to the ovary.
  * **Ovary:** It is the swollen bottom part of the carpel. It contains ovules having an egg cell (female gamete).

### Pollination
The transfer of pollen grains from the anther of the stamen to the stigma of the flower is termed as pollination. The pollen grains can be transferred by various agents like wind, water, insects and animals.

Pollination usually occurs in two ways
**1. Self-pollination:** The pollen from the stamen of a flower is transferred to the stigma of the same flower or another flower of the same plant.

**2. Cross-pollintaion:** The pollen from the stamen of the flower is transferred to the stigma of another flower of different plant of the same speicies.

### Fertilisation
It is the process of fusion of male and female gametes. It gives rise to a **Zygote**. As soon as the pollen lands on suitable stigma, it reaches the female germ cells in the ovary. This occurs *via* pollen tube. The pollen tube flows out of the pollen grains, travels through the style and finally reaches the ovary.

After fertilisation, ovule develops a rough coat around itself and gets converted to seeds and ovary ripens as fruit.

The seeds contain future embryo that grows under suitable conditions (germintaion). The fertilisation in the flowering plant is shown in the given figure

## Sexual Reproduction in Human Beings
Human beings can reproduce sexually after attaining **Puberty**. It represents period of adolescence when reproductive organs start developing and sexual maturity is attained. Some changes during puberty are common in males and females such as hair growth in armpits and genitials, oily skin, acne, etc.

Specific changes in boys include facial hair growth, hoarse voice, etc. In girls, these changes are enlargement of breast size, begining of menstruation, etc.
