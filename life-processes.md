1. **Nutrition:** The process by which an organism takes food and utilizes it, is called nutrition.

2. **Need for Nutrition:** Organisms need the energy to perform various activities. The energy is supplied by the nutrients. Organisms need various raw materials for growth and repair. These raw materials are provided by nutrients.

3. **Nutrients:** Materials which provide nutrition to organisms are called nutrients. Carbohydrates, proteins and fats are the main nutrients and are called macronutrients. Minerals and vitamins are required in small amounts and hence are called micronutrients.

4. **Modes of Nutrition**

* Autotrophic Nutrition.

* Heterotrophic Nutrition.

## Autotrophic Nutrition

The mode of nutrition in which an organism prepares its own food is called autotrophic nutrition. Green plants and blue-green algae follow the autotrophic mode of nutrition.

* The organisms which carry out autotrophic nutrition are called autotrophs (green plants).

* Autotrophic nutrition is fulfilled by the process, by which autotrophs intake CO2 and H2O, and convert these into carbohydrates in the presence of chlorophyll, sunlight is called photosynthesis.

5. **Nutrition in Plants:** Green plants prepare their own food. They make food in the presence of sunlight. Sunlight provides energyâ€™, carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials and chloroplast is the site where food is made.

### What is Photosynthesis?

**Photosynthesis:** The process by which green plants prepare food is called photosynthesis.

* During this process, the solar energy is converted into chemical energy and carbohydrates are formed.

* Green leaves are the main site of photosynthesis.

* The green portion of the plant contains a pigment chloroplast, chlorophyll (green pigment).

* The whole process of photosynthesis can be shown by the following equation:
